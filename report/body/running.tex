\section{Running the App}
The app was then tested by visiting the \textit{sign in} page of static website. A user was registered and then redirect to the verification page. As expected, an email was received containing a verification code.

\noindent Finally the main aspect of the serverless web app could be tested by entering a location on the map and choosing \textit{Request a Unicorn}. This returned a response to the user containing a Unicorn and some details, shown if \autoref{fig:result}. The web also demonstrated that the user has successfully received a JSON web token, verifying that the user authentication is working.
